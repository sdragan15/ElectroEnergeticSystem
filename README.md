Project for Computer Graphics

- Project was done in C#, WPF

- Shows substations, nodes, and switches from XML file. Transforms coordinates from file to latitude and longitude, then calculated coordinates 
  by that so that every substation, node, and switch has its own coords.
- Implemented zoom and pan
- Connect nodes pairs with the BFS algorithm.

- To start program, you need to copy Geographic.xml file to EESystem/EESystem/Bin/Debug/net6.0-windows folder
